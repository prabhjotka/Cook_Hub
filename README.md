# Shell-React-Express

React-Express Shell app ready for node deployment to a cloud platform.  React and Express code are separate mini-projects and build/deployment is handled by the top level package.json

When the React App starts, it makes a single API call to the API server for the version number and renders that, or an error if API call was unsucessful

Built for node 18
